This is a sample React application that uses Recoil for state management to display a list of posts for a given user ID. The application is composed of three files: App.tsx, selectors.ts, and api.ts.

App.tsx
This file contains the main component of the application, App. It imports useRecoilValueLoadable and RecoilRoot from recoil and postsQuery from selectors.ts. The App component renders a list of posts for a specific user ID, passed as a constant variable userId. The useRecoilValueLoadable hook is used to retrieve the posts data using the postsQuery selector. Depending on the state of the postsLoadable variable, the component renders either a loading spinner or the list of posts. If an error occurs, the error message is displayed.

selectors.ts
This file contains two selectorFamily functions, postsState and postsQuery. These functions are used to define and retrieve the posts state from the Recoil store. The postsQuery selector filters the full list of posts fetched from api.ts by the provided id. The postsState selector retrieves the postsQuery selector result from the Recoil store using get function.

api.ts
This file contains the fetchPosts function which fetches the list of posts from the JSONPlaceholder API. It returns a promise that resolves to an array of Post objects. The Post interface defines the structure of a post object with userId, id, title, and body properties.

Overall, this is a simple application that demonstrates how to use Recoil for state management in a React application. It fetches data from an external API, filters it by a specific user ID, and displays the filtered data in the UI.
