### Recoil State Management Example
This application consists of a single component called Counter that manages a count state using an atom. It also uses a selector to determine if the count is odd and display a message accordingly.

The RecoilRoot component wraps the Counter component to provide the Recoil context necessary for the state management to work.

The useRecoilState and useRecoilValueLoadable hooks are used to read and update the state. The useRecoilValueLoadable hook returns a Loadable object that represents the state of an asynchronous selector.

When the Increment button is clicked, the setCount function is called to update the count state. The oddMessageLoadable object is then updated to reflect the new count value.
